    <p class="bio">Hello, my name is Warren and I work as a remote sensing analyst for the Las Vegas Valley Water District in Las Vegas, Nevada. I have a passion for data analysis, mathematics, computer science, and geography. I graduated from the University of California, Santa Barbara with a bachelor’s degree in geography and history in June of 2015. Currently I am working on my master’s degree through the online GIS Professional Program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison which specializes in GIS Development.</p>
    <p class="bio">In my line of work I implement statistically driven machine learning algorithms to classify high spatial resolution multispectral imagery as well as work with high density LiDAR data. Outside of work I have a huge fascination with Bayesian thinking, probability & statistics, calculus, linear algebra, Fourier analysis, and numerical analysis (before starting my masters program, I would come home from work and study free online MIT courses just for the fun of it…because you know, that is just what you do for fun in Vegas). I enjoy working with computer languages and developing software and this is a huge reason as to why I joined the UW-Madison’s online masters program. Outside of mathematics and computer science, I have quite the passion for playing piano and guitar. In fact, I have been playing the piano since age four and learned how to read music before I even learned how to actually read and write. Prior to starting my career in remote sensing I used to be a piano teacher for a local music store in Redlands, California and would perform on a weekly basis for the Loma Linda University Medical Center and Children’s Hospital in Loma Linda, California.
        </p>
        
        <p id="bio2">While I love math and science, I will admit that I am very new to the field of graphic design and I am currently trying to learn and improve as much as I can. This online portfolio will show the evolution of my skill in graphic design as I continue to hopefully become better at it with time. If you would like to contact me you can email me at wkunkler92@gmail.com or visit my LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/warren-kunkler-841735a0/">here</a>. </p>
