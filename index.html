    <p class="bio" id="firstP">Hello, my name is Warren and I work as a remote sensing analyst for the Las Vegas Valley Water District in Las Vegas, Nevada. I have a passion for data analysis, mathematics, computer programming, and geography. I graduated from the University of California, Santa Barbara with a bachelor’s degree in geography and history in June of 2015. Currently I am working on my master’s degree through the online GIS Professional Program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison which specializes in GIS Development.</p>
            
            
    <p class="bio">In my line of work I implement statistically driven machine learning algorithms to classify high spatial resolution multispectral imagery as well as work with high density LiDAR data. Outside of work I have a huge fascination with different fields of mathematics and how they apply to GIS and Remote Sensing. In particular I have been very fascinated by linear algebra, Fourier analysis, calculus, and statistics.</p>
        <p class="bio"> I also enjoy working with computer languages and developing software and this is a huge reason as to why I joined the UW-Madison’s online masters program. Outside of mathematics and computer programming, I have quite the passion for music as I have been playing piano and guitar. In fact, prior to starting my career in remote sensing I used to be a piano teacher and would perform on a weekly basis for the Loma Linda University Medical Center. 
        </p>
        
        <p id="bio2"> This online portfolio will show the evolution of my skill in graphic design as I continue to hopefully become better at it with time.
